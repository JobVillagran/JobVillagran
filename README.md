I am a self-taught developer with a strong eye for innovative design and a keen understanding of techniques geared toward optimum user experience. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Angular and MySQL. Also as part of my culture I focused as well on customer experience by generating value with proper communication.
